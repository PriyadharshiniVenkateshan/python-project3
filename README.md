# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## Description

The Snake Game is a popular arcade game in which the player controls a snake on a rectangular grid. The objective is to eat food that appears on the screen and grow longer while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the grid.

This implementation of the Snake Game features a graphical user interface created with Pygame, allowing for intuitive controls and an enjoyable gaming experience.

## Key Features

- Responsive controls: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake in different directions.
- Food generation: Randomly generates food items on the grid for the snake to consume.
- Scoring system: Keep track of the player's score based on the number of food items consumed.
- Game over condition: The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the boundaries of the grid.
- Play again option: After the game ends, the player has the choice to restart the game.
